We are developing an ecosystem which will consist of various innovative developments and applications that will set us apart from the competition. Hector is community guided with $HEC holders deciding the future.
 Hector Finance is creating a suite of use cases which will provide true utility to the $HEC token.
Profits from the ecosystem will be used to buyback and burn tokens from the open market,
allowing $HEC to be deflationary over time.
Hector Finance operates the world’s first deflationary rebase token. This means that those who stake our
native $HEC token receive rewards from rebases, as well as the inherent rewards of a deflationary token.
Our token supply peaked at 3,530,424. Within two months of setting the goal of becoming deflationary
we achieved a 14% reduction in the total supply of HEC tokens.
In the final quarter of 2021, Hector Finance built a treasury of more than $100,000,000 in stablecoins
by offering bonds of the HEC token at a discount to market prices. We now have one of the largest
development funds of any project in the space. We are using those funds to develop a suite of products
and services to aid the expansion of the Hector Ecosystem. Whilst not in use, the majority of the treasury
is invested. Assuming moderate performance of these investments, we can accumulate more than
$10,000,000 per year from interest alone into the treasury to support further development costs.
On March 29th 2022, the Hector Finance Community voted to begin an emission plan which will create
a fixed supply cap for the HEC token.
The progression of the emission plan means we can guarantee how many tokens will be minted as
well as guarantee a supply cap for HEC whilst still making predictable changes to the APY over time.
Additionally, the plan allows us to invite users to lock their tokens for a boosted reward, reducing selling
pressure.

Mission & Vision 


We envision a future where power is radically decentralized – people can easily

coercive monopolies; wealth is fairly distributed; and machines handle the
boring work while humans focus on meaningful pursuits.


We believe that web3 will be a key part of this future and we’re here to build
it.

Similarly, the goal is the development of the protocol. This includes the technical aspects (writing new features in the core contracts), but also the marketing aspects (promoting the protocol), or even operational ones around the DAO itself.
The tools we use are the UDT tokens to get started, as the way to establish voting, but also a brand new Governance contract. The Governance Contract uses OpenZeppelin’s libraries (see our code) and sets the process through which the DAO makes decision. To get started, we set a few defaults for these rules, but they can be altered by the community.

The rooms are then rented out to low-income tenants, which not only allows them better housing, but it gives them a chance to become financially stable.  The rents per room ranges between $600-$900 per month fully furnished, with all utilities and internet included. This means an 8 bedroom property could generate between $4800-$7200 per month of cashflow for the DAO, while also providing an instant solution to those waiting for housing.

 Unique features of Gearbox Protocol
Other protocols can offer leverage to their users with the help of Gearbox Protocol, without modifying anything in their own architecture. As such, they also get exposure to the user base of Gearbox.
Positions and trades within Credit Accounts can be extended to include complex strategies, for example, making a short position farm in Yearn; or having LP tokens as collateral for more composable actions.
The leverage offered is not based on synthetic positions but instead is executed with real assets on third-party protocols. Because Gearbox does not create its own trading pairs, there is no short-long ratio that needs to be maintained with funding rates.

The formula allows us to offer a lifetime partnership. We achieve this by replanting the coconut trees once they stop bearing fruits, a one-time contribution equals a lifetime of rewards and benefits.
Vision
Kokonut Network is born from the vision of lowering the barrier for agriculture development, rural project funding, and democratizing investing into real-world projects. We can leverage and create a multitude of projects, that bring benefits to global crypto communities and every individual that wants to participate. We count on all the permits necessary from the government, weather, and fertile land. Coconut farming is a proven business that has a lot of upsides.
Differentiation
There are a lot of DAOs out there that are just cool ideas, great design & marketing. Without a real business backing their idea. A lot of projects get rug-pulled or end up abandoned by their users because they don’t deliver a good product.
We at Kokonut Network have a different way of doing things. Instead of founding our proposal or business plan on exploiting our users, trying to hype them to buy some non-backed token. We have created a system to promote, fund, and manage coconut farms, that is time-proof, backed by real coconut plants in our land, DAO for funds governance, funds allocation & rewards sharing.

 Sushi is a community-driven organization built to solve what might be called the “liquidity problem.” One could define this problem as the inability of disparate forms of liquidity to connect with markets in a decentralized way, and vice versa. While other solutions provide incrementally progressive advances toward solving the problem of liquidity, Sushi’s progress is intended to create a broader range of network effects. Rather than limiting itself to a single solution, Sushi intertwines many decentralized markets and instruments.
Much like the banking system is the base-layer for financial operations in traditional finance, SushiSwap’s BentoBox is the base-layer for all the future financial instruments Sushi intends to offer. Trident, for instance, which is a factory system for producing liquidity pools, will be built on top of Bento, as will Mirin — a system for whitelisted users where they can interact with each other in good faith and fair dealings. Because they are all built on the BentoBox, pending orders and idle capital that are using these instruments will be eligible to be applied to strategies and flash loans, which generates more yield for the user.

By providing the tools for people to turn a community, cause, or even a meme into its own economy, we can unlock a long-tail of DAOs that are not limited just to protocols like Ethereum or Bitcoin.
Aragon not only provides basic financial tools like tokenization but can create reproducible and broadly applicable templates for defining the boundaries of a community and flowing value to contributors over the internet without traditional intermediaries.

 Hashstack’s Open protocol is DeFi’s only secure non custodial lending solution enabling under-collateralized loans upto 1:3 collateral-to-loan ratio. This means, on Open, you can borrow upto $300 by providing only $100 as a collateral. Of this, you can withdraw $70(i.e. upto 70% collateral), while utilising $230 as in-platform trading capital.
In comparison, defi lending as of today is over collateralised. On average a borrower provides a minimum of 42% excess collateral against the loan they intend to borrow. This creates a systemic design flaw, which is addressed through Open protocol.
What’s Unique

Open is the first meaningful step towards providing autonomous under-collateralised loans. No credit score, no anchorage required.
-Stabler APY & APR, catalysed by compartmentalised deposits, loans & effective asset utilisation.
