hector finance dao,"['DeFi', 'Gaming', 'Investment', 'Metaverse', 'other', 'Social Impact', 'Venture Capital']","Hector Finance is a decentralized protocol based on the HEC token. We are developing an ecosystem which will consist of various innovative developments and applications that will set us apart from the competition. Hector is community guided with $HEC holders deciding the future.
 Hector Finance is creating a suite of use cases which will provide true utility to the $HEC token.
Profits from the ecosystem will be used to buyback and burn tokens from the open market,
allowing $HEC to be deflationary over time.
Hector Finance operates the world’s first deflationary rebase token. This means that those who stake our
native $HEC token receive rewards from rebases, as well as the inherent rewards of a deflationary token.
Our token supply peaked at 3,530,424. Within two months of setting the goal of becoming deflationary
we achieved a 14% reduction in the total supply of HEC tokens.
In the final quarter of 2021, Hector Finance built a treasury of more than $100,000,000 in stablecoins
by offering bonds of the HEC token at a discount to market prices. We now have one of the largest
development funds of any project in the space. We are using those funds to develop a suite of products
and services to aid the expansion of the Hector Ecosystem. Whilst not in use, the majority of the treasury
is invested. Assuming moderate performance of these investments, we can accumulate more than
$10,000,000 per year from interest alone into the treasury to support further development costs.
On March 29th 2022, the Hector Finance Community voted to begin an emission plan which will create
a fixed supply cap for the HEC token.
The progression of the emission plan means we can guarantee how many tokens will be minted as
well as guarantee a supply cap for HEC whilst still making predictable changes to the APY over time.
Additionally, the plan allows us to invite users to lock their tokens for a boosted reward, reducing selling
pressure.

it.

 Our Community unlocks the potential of a secure decentralized governance structure represented by ROCS units (or tokens) to fund, scale, and share in the profitability of E-Commerce Brands.
We’re leading innovative financing solutions to fund brands through decentralized currency and a resourceful community.
Every E-Commerce product based business owner deals with the struggles of irregular cashflow patterns. They’re caught between forecasting the capital needed for inventory and sustainable business expansion and traditional lending institutions with solutions that weren’t designed for web based business. Operators are left with a major delta between the need for favorable terms in financing and options from these lending services or p&l based lending.
E-commerce business owners are web1 and web2 native and open to non traditional financing options including cryptocurrency. There is an opportunity in the market to both extend short term financing options and aggregate a portfolio of E-Commerce and FBA businesses through decentralized currency lending and the purchasing power of a DAO.
Red Rock DAO is organized as a Wyoming DAO limited liability company.

 Trustless verification of identity in web3 is a complex task complicated by an ever-changing legal and regulatory landscape and a dizzying array of one-off “verification” service providers that are often unreliable.
How can we solve this ?
kycDAO is here to help. Onchain KYC NFTs, which are issued to each of our verified community members as nontransferable tokens, serve as a unified approach for the web3 community to interact with a variety of protocols and dApps.
We are creating a shared bridge of on-chain proofs that enable the web3 service providers to deliver products to verified users

superteam dao,['Social Impact'],"Helping the most promising Solana projects launch & grow in the ascending world
 We help the most promising projects in the Solana ecosystem in the ascending world (India, South East Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa) launch and grow. We are organized as a co-operative of creatives, operators, and investors who are experienced in launching and growing technology businesses.
We value the sovereignty that comes with founding a company, the skin in the game that comes with investing, and the joy that comes with getting sh*t done. In a pre-crypto world, we had to fit into broiler categories — founder, investor, or employee. Crypto allows us to be free-range and be all 3 at the same time.
This workspace is raw, WIP, and meant for our community. We’re turning our organization inside-out so you can lurk, find opportunities and join us on this adventure.

Kokonut Network promotes, organizes, funds, and manages coconut farms. We gather funds from the community using the DAOHaus framework for decision-making and project development.
 When you mix agriculture + blockchain + web3 + perfect weather, and soil, this formula allows us to create an amazing investment opportunity that doesn’t have an expiration date. The formula allows us to offer a lifetime partnership. We achieve this by replanting the coconut trees once they stop bearing fruits, a one-time contribution equals a lifetime of rewards and benefits.
Vision
Kokonut Network is born from the vision of lowering the barrier for agriculture development, rural project funding, and democratizing investing into real-world projects. We can leverage and create a multitude of projects, that bring benefits to global crypto communities and every individual that wants to participate. We count on all the permits necessary from the government, weather, and fertile land. Coconut farming is a proven business that has a lot of upsides.
Differentiation
There are a lot of DAOs out there that are just cool ideas, great design & marketing. Without a real business backing their idea. A lot of projects get rug-pulled or end up abandoned by their users because they don’t deliver a good product.
We at Kokonut Network have a different way of doing things. Instead of founding our proposal or business plan on exploiting our users, trying to hype them to buy some non-backed token. We have created a system to promote, fund, and manage coconut farms, that is time-proof, backed by real coconut plants in our land, DAO for funds governance, funds allocation & rewards sharing.

 Sushi is a community-driven organization built to solve what might be called the “liquidity problem.” One could define this problem as the inability of disparate forms of liquidity to connect with markets in a decentralized way, and vice versa. While other solutions provide incrementally progressive advances toward solving the problem of liquidity, Sushi’s progress is intended to create a broader range of network effects. Rather than limiting itself to a single solution, Sushi intertwines many decentralized markets and instruments.
Much like the banking system is the base-layer for financial operations in traditional finance, SushiSwap’s BentoBox is the base-layer for all the future financial instruments Sushi intends to offer. Trident, for instance, which is a factory system for producing liquidity pools, will be built on top of Bento, as will Mirin — a system for whitelisted users where they can interact with each other in good faith and fair dealings. Because they are all built on the BentoBox, pending orders and idle capital that are using these instruments will be eligible to be applied to strategies and flash loans, which generates more yield for the user.

 Hashstack’s Open protocol is DeFi’s only secure non custodial lending solution enabling under-collateralized loans upto 1:3 collateral-to-loan ratio. This means, on Open, you can borrow upto $300 by providing only $100 as a collateral. Of this, you can withdraw $70(i.e. upto 70% collateral), while utilising $230 as in-platform trading capital.
In comparison, defi lending as of today is over collateralised. On average a borrower provides a minimum of 42% excess collateral against the loan they intend to borrow. This creates a systemic design flaw, which is addressed through Open protocol.
What’s Unique

Open is the first meaningful step towards providing autonomous under-collateralised loans. No credit score, no anchorage required.

-Open will bridge assets of other chains such as Ethereum as an expansion of its primary markets
